# portfolio-website
Hello Guys! This is my portfolio website where I showcase some stuff I've worked on in Graphics and UX design. 

# page structure
The page starts of with a home section which has a navigation bar that can take the user to all the other sections with just one click. The navigation bar is fixed to the top meaning the user will always see it even when they scroll down the web page. In the navigation bar we have a logo with my name that takes the user back to the home section when clicked. The home button does the same. We also have the about, portfolio, contacts, contact me and services buttons for the respective sections in the portfolio. Next there's the about me section that gives the user more information about me and the skills I have. A fun feature I placed here was the horizontal animation when you hover your cursor above the skills in the skills list. 

Next we have the services section that gives more information about the services I offer. The portfolio section contaons a couple of posters that I've worked on displayed side by side with a horizontal scroll bar.

# future plans to incorporate backend
I've also used semantic HTML to separate all these sections in the webpage and used id selectors for styling in the CSS file. The contact me section has a form where a user can submit a message to me. As of now the form still doesn't submit a message but I'm working on having it linked to a database using php or Node JS ans Express JS. 

# responsive design
The website is also fully responsive having two breaing points to allow for responsive design for different screen dimensions. In the first break the navigation bar section changes to a drop down menu with an icon that can be clicked to bring it up.

# hosting 
Since this is mostly a static website with no fully functioning backend at the moment, I'm planning tohost it either using Netlify or with GitHub pages. In future commits, I'll have these set up.
